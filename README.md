# <img src="logo.png" width="48"/> Latte Dock NG

> **Fork notice**: This is an unofficial fork of [KDE Latte Dock](https://github.com/KDE/latte-dock) maintained by Ruizhi Zhong, targeting **KDE Plasma 6.6+ on Wayland only**. X11 support has been intentionally removed.

Latte Dock NG is a Wayland-first dock for KDE Plasma 6.6+ that provides an elegant and intuitive experience for your tasks and widgets. It animates its contents using a parabolic zoom effect and stays out of the way when not needed.
