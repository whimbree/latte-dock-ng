# Changelog

All notable changes to Latte Dock NG are documented in this file.

## [v1.2.16] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Fixed digital clock widget overflowing past the dock edge and overlapping
  neighboring icons when using long date formats.  The natural-width cap was
  increased from 3× to 5× maxIconSize to accommodate formats like "Saturday,
  June 27, 2026 10:30 AM".
- Fixed "Unable to assign [undefined] to int" startup warning from
  MyView.qml:37.  Added a safeInt() helper that validates bridge-host
  property values before assignment, preventing undefined from reaching
  int-typed properties during initialization and bridge transitions.
- Guarded LayerShellQt::Window::setScreen with CMake feature detection to
  prevent build failures when the LayerShellQt version lacks the method.

### Test
- Added 60+ source contract regression tests covering widget-specific
  special handling: digital clock sizing, middle-click close active window,
  auto-pin on drag, scroll minimize/unmaximize, system tray guards, volume
  and application menu popup sizing, clipboard/digital-clock error
  suppression, applet insertion boundaries, separator/spacer detection,
  and MyView int property guard.

## [v1.2.15] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- Fixed systemsettings and other KDE applications crashing on startup due to KNS compat QML import paths leaking into child processes via environment variables. All QML and plugin import paths are now engine-scoped using `addImportPath()` and `addLibraryPath()` instead of `qputenv()`.
- Fixed `uninstall.sh` to clean up KNS compat QML overrides from both old (`~/.local/lib*/qt6/qml/`) and new private paths during uninstall.

## [v1.2.14] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Fixed middle-click close active window not working on empty dock areas.
- Fixed scroll-down minimize not working for ScrollToggleMinimized action.
- Fixed auto-pin when dragging non-pinned tasks into launcher area.
- Fixed drag-and-drop icon reordering stability and visual feedback.

## [v1.2.13] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Fixed KNS dialog compatibility QML overrides being written to Qt's global user QML path (`~/.local/lib*/qt6/qml/`), which could crash incompatible KDE applications like systemsettings on startup.
- Fixed `uninstall.sh` to clean up KNS compat overrides from both old (global QML) and new (private) paths during uninstall.

## [v1.2.12] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- Fixed widget hide/show synchronization across all screens during removal and undo.
- Fixed Plasma panel overlap for vertical docks on multi-screen Wayland setups.

## [v1.2.11] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- Fixed all-screens dock synchronization for widget removal, widget add, drag-and-drop widget placement, applet ordering, and launcher/menu-backed applets.
- Fixed Wayland always-visible dock strut reservations so cloned docks reserve space on their own screen instead of affecting the primary screen.
- Refined session shutdown handling so Latte quits after committed shutdown blockers close while still surviving cancelled logout attempts.
- Fixed duplicate instance handling to exit cleanly with return 0 instead of calling qGuiApp->exit(), and moved SharedQmlEngine creation after the single-instance guard to avoid unnecessary teardown.

## [v1.2.10] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Session shutdown handling now stays alive when logout is cancelled while still quitting cleanly after blocking windows close during committed shutdown.
- Modern dock background shadows now default to the same compact 6px effect as explicitly setting Appearance > Background > Shadow to 6px.

## [v1.2.9] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- Task icons now refresh immediately when the system icon theme changes, including switching back to the default Breeze icon theme.
- Audio stream badges now scale with task icon zoom while preserving their relative position.

## [v1.1.26] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- Analog clock widget no longer produces extra empty space on both sides when added to the dock. The clock was incorrectly classified as a text-heavy applet alongside the digital clock, causing an oversized slot allocation.

### Changed
- Wrap global-scope classes in namespace Latte to prevent symbol collisions
- Replace string-based SIGNAL()/SLOT() macros with type-safe &Class::method syntax
- Add override keyword to 46 virtual destructors for compiler-enforced signature checking
- Replace [&] lambda captures with [this] in connect callbacks to prevent dangling references
- Replace C-style casts with static_cast<> for type safety
- Centralize scattered plugin name strings into shared app/pluginids.h header
- Add required keyword to critical QML properties for clear runtime errors
- Create Constants.qml documenting shared visual-proportion values
- Replace const T return-by-value with T to enable move semantics in GenericTable
- Use concrete QML types (point, Instantiator) instead of var where applicable


## [v1.1.23] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- Volume widget and systray volume icon no longer show incorrect muted state when first added to a dock. PulseAudio output device subscription is primed at startup and a repeating safety timer forces plasma-pa's PreferredDevice to read the initial default sink state.
- Updating/reinstalling no longer silently deletes user custom dock configurations. The pre-clean step now preserves `~/.config/latte/` and saved layouts unless `--purge-user-data` is explicitly passed.

## [v1.1.22] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- Volume widget and systray volume icon no longer show incorrect muted state when first added after a cold system boot. PulseAudio output device (SinkModel) subscription is now primed at startup alongside the existing stream subscription.

## [v1.1.22] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- Updating/reinstalling no longer silently deletes user custom dock configurations. The pre-clean step now preserves `~/.config/latte/` and saved layouts unless `--purge-user-data` is explicitly passed.

## [v1.1.21] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- Automatic QML disk cache clearing on version change, preventing stale compiled QML from masking fixes after upgrades.

### Fixed
- Default background thickness in new docks now correctly defaults to 6% (was 10% due to stale template values).

### Changed
- Project license upgraded from GPL-2.0-or-later to GPL-3.0-or-later.

## [v1.1.20] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- Eliminated binding loop on `inNormalState` property in visibility controller.
- Prevented false muted icon when no audio stream exists.

## [v1.1.19] - 2026-06-13

### Changed
- Moved taskmanager fallback QML module from `org.kde.plasma.private.taskmanager` to `org.kde.latte.compat.taskmanager`, so latte no longer installs or removes files in Plasma's namespace.
- Removed dead `TaskManagerApplet` import from `TaskItem.qml`.

### Fixed
- Wheel events now pass through to all external applets, not just systray.
- Wayland no longer destroys applet popups on open.
- Widget explorer now uses single-click to add widgets instead of double-click.
- External C++ plasmoids that request `fillWidth` now render correctly.
- Widget explorer places new applets before systray/tasks, not at dock end.
- Systray drag-and-drop reorder works without breaking layout.
- Suppressed benign KDE framework property override warnings and KIO teardown errors.

## [v1.0.14] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Added the modern dock style screenshot to README.
- Added modern/classic dock style switching support with preserved parabolic animation behavior.

### Fixed
- Fixed Justify alignment for both modern and classic dock styles by removing the legacy splitter-based layout path from dock-style views.
- Fixed widget/task spacing, separator placement, widget drag ordering, and style-specific indicator behavior across classic and modern dock styles.
- Cleaned temporary debug logs after validation so startup logs stay focused on actionable warnings/errors.

## [v1.0.8] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- Refined task icon highlight behavior to avoid stale clicked-highlight regression while preserving hover feedback behavior.
- Improved task-state indicator contrast logic against panel light/dark themes, while keeping audio mute/unmute corner badge color independent.
- Fixed task drag sorting policy:
  - dragging a non-pinned running app into pinned area now auto-pins it and reorders into the target position;
  - dragging a pinned launcher into non-pinned area remains blocked.

## [v1.0.6] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Fixed mixed install/runtime import-path regression: system installs no longer force-load `~/.local` Qt6 QML paths by default.
- Prevented stale user-local QML trees from overriding packaged system modules when launching `/usr/bin/latte-dock-ng`.
- Added explicit env toggles for diagnostics:
  - `LATTE_FORCE_USER_LOCAL_QML_IMPORTS=1`
  - `LATTE_DISABLE_USER_LOCAL_QML_IMPORTS=1`

## [v1.0.5] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Fixed logout/session shutdown blocking by adding a reliable Wayland session-end path:
  - detect KDE session shutdown via `org.kde.ksmserver.isShuttingDown()`
  - mark fast teardown state consistently
  - quit Latte promptly when shutdown is detected.
- Fixed indicator-record removal crash path during teardown (`removeAt(-1)` guard in `Indicator::Factory::removeIndicatorRecords`).

## [v1.0.4] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Fixed context-menu callback lifecycle for "More Places" to avoid stale-object warnings in `ContextMenu.qml`.
- Fixed audio badge interaction so clicking the mute indicator no longer leaves a stuck selected/highlight state.

### Changed
- Aligned the audio badge input model with Plasma 6 task-manager behavior (`HoverHandler`/`TapHandler` for click/hover state, wheel handling isolated).

## [v1.0.3] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Added fallback app-name hover tooltip for dock task items when thin-tooltip is unavailable.
- Replaced README screenshot with the latest Latte Dock NG screenshot asset.

### Changed
- Bumped runtime/application version to `1.0.3` to keep About dialog aligned with release tag.

## [v1.0.2] - 2026-05-03

### Notes
- Baseline public release tag.
